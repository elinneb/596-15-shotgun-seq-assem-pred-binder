## Import trimmed, filtered reads from the taxonomy analysis workflow (automatically done)


## Perform de novo assembly of reads using MEGAHIT assembler
## Could perform assembly one at a time, but it took over 3 hours on 8 samples, so we'll do 1 here

megahit -1 HL1-8_trimmed/HL1_R1_paired.fastq.gz -2 HL1-8_trimmed/HL1_R2_paired.fastq.gz -o ~/megahit_output_HL1


## Copy assembly output into folder with other sample contigs files (assembly on them was pre-done)

cp ~/megahit_output_HL1/final.contigs.fa ~/HL_final_contigs/HL1_final.contigs.fa
